## Summary

With there being so many employees of retirement age there are going to be a lot of positions needing to be filled in the coming years. But with the employees at there retirement age means they may have the necessary experience to mentor furture employees. There are 7 departments in the company and the only department that may be lacking the amount of possible mentors is the Manager department with there being only 2 employees at retirement age. However their are probably employees with the necessary experience to mentor furture managers who are not currently at retirement age but can still fill that role for the company.
